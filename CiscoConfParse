Installing ciscoconfparse

ciscoconfparse needs Python versions 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2+; the OS should not matter. If you want to run it under a Python virtualenv, it’s been heavily tested in that environment as well.

You can check your python version with the -V switch...

[mpenning@Mudslide ~]$ python -V
Python 2.7.3
[mpenning@Mudslide ~]$

The best way to get ciscoconfparse is with pip or setuptools.
Install with pip

If you already have pip, you can install as usual:

Alternatively you can install with pip:

pip install --upgrade ciscoconfparse

If you have a specific version of ciscoconfparse in mind, you can specify that at the command-line

pip install ciscoconfparse==1.2.37

Install with setuptools

If you don’t have pip, you can use setuptools...

# Substitute whatever ciscoconfparse version you like...
easy_install -U ciscoconfparse

If you have a specific version of ciscoconfparse in mind, you can specify that at the command-line

easy_install -U ciscoconfparse==1.2.37

Install from the source

If you don’t have either pip or setuptools, you can download the ciscoconfparse compressed tarball, extract it and run the setup.py script in the tarball:

python setup.py install

Github and Bitbucket

If you’re interested in the source, you can always pull from the github repo or bitbucket repo:

    From bitbucket (this also assumes you have mercurial):

    hg init
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/mpenning/ciscoconfparse

    From github:

    git clone git://github.com//mpenning/ciscoconfparse
